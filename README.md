A collection of some of my solutions to several LeetCode problems

## 161. One Edit Distance

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return false.

A string s is said to be one distance apart from a string t if you can:

Insert exactly one character into s to get t.
Delete exactly one character from s to get t.
Replace exactly one character of s with a different character to get t

## 187. Repeated DNA Sequences

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.


## 361. Bomb Enemy

Given an m x n matrix grid where each cell is either a wall 'W', an enemy 'E' or empty '0', return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb. You can only place the bomb in an empty cell.

The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted point until it hits the wall since it is too strong to be destroyed.

## 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters:

Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.

## 651. 4 Keys Keyboard

Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:

A: Print one 'A' on the screen.
Ctrl-A: Select the whole screen.
Ctrl-C: Copy selection to buffer.
Ctrl-V: Print buffer on screen appending it after what has already been printed.
Given an integer n, return the maximum number of 'A' you can print on the screen with at most n presses on the keys.

## 1229. Meeting Scheduler

Given the availability time slots arrays slots1 and slots2 of two people and a meeting duration duration, return the earliest time slot that works for both of them and is of duration duration.

If there is no common time slot that satisfies the requirements, return an empty array.

The format of a time slot is an array of two elements [start, end] representing an inclusive time range from start to end.

It is guaranteed that no two availability slots of the same person intersect with each other. That is, for any two time slots [start1, end1] and [start2, end2] of the same person, either start1 > end2 or start2 > end1.
