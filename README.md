### 161. One Edit Distance

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return false.

A string s is said to be one distance apart from a string t if you can:

Insert exactly one character into s to get t.
Delete exactly one character from s to get t.
Replace exactly one character of s with a different character to get t



### 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters:

Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.


### 576. Out of Boundary Paths

There is an m x n grid with a ball. The ball is initially at the position [startRow, startColumn]. You are allowed to move the ball to one of the four adjacent cells in the grid (possibly out of the grid crossing the grid boundary). You can apply at most maxMove moves to the ball.

Given the five integers m, n, maxMove, startRow, startColumn, return the number of paths to move the ball out of the grid boundary. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
