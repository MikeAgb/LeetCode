A collection of some of my solutions to several LeetCode problems.

## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Medium)

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## 5. Longest Palindromic Substring (Medium)

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

## 11. Container With Most Water (Medium)

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

## 15. 3Sum (Medium)

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.
Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## 22. Generate Parentheses (Medium)

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

## 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array (Medium)

Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## 36. Valid Sudoku (Medium)

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

## 48. Rotate Image (Medium)

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise)
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

## 49. Group Anagrams (Medium)

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## 50. Pow(x, n)

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

## 59. Spiral Matrix II (Medium)

Given a positive integer n, generate an n x n matrix filled with elements from 1 to n2 in spiral order.

## 62. Unique Paths (Medium)

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

## 73. Set Matrix Zeroes (Medium)

Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's, and return the matrix.

You must do it in place.

## 161. One Edit Distance (Medium)

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return false.

A string s is said to be one distance apart from a string t if you can:

Insert exactly one character into s to get t.
Delete exactly one character from s to get t.
Replace exactly one character of s with a different character to get t

## 187. Repeated DNA Sequences (Medium)

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.


## 361. Bomb Enemy (Medium)

Given an m x n matrix grid where each cell is either a wall 'W', an enemy 'E' or empty '0', return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb. You can only place the bomb in an empty cell.

The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted point until it hits the wall since it is too strong to be destroyed.

## 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters (Medium)

Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.

## 651. 4 Keys Keyboard (Medium)

Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:

A: Print one 'A' on the screen.
Ctrl-A: Select the whole screen.
Ctrl-C: Copy selection to buffer.
Ctrl-V: Print buffer on screen appending it after what has already been printed.
Given an integer n, return the maximum number of 'A' you can print on the screen with at most n presses on the keys.

## 1229. Meeting Scheduler (Medium)

Given the availability time slots arrays slots1 and slots2 of two people and a meeting duration duration, return the earliest time slot that works for both of them and is of duration duration.

If there is no common time slot that satisfies the requirements, return an empty array.

The format of a time slot is an array of two elements [start, end] representing an inclusive time range from start to end.

It is guaranteed that no two availability slots of the same person intersect with each other. That is, for any two time slots [start1, end1] and [start2, end2] of the same person, either start1 > end2 or start2 > end1.
