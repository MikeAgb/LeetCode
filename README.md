You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise)
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

## 49. Group Anagrams (Medium)

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## 57. Insert Interval (Medium)

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.

The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

## 75. Sort Colors (Medium)

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

## 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II (Medium)

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

## 98. Validate Binary Search Tree (Medium)

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## 99. Recover Binary Search Tree (Medium)

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.

## 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (Medium)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).


## 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal (Medium)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

## 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node (Medium)

You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

## 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II (Medium)

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence (Medium)

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

## 161. One Edit Distance (Medium)

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return false.

A string s is said to be one distance apart from a string t if you can:

Insert exactly one character into s to get t.
Delete exactly one character from s to get t.
Replace exactly one character of s with a different character to get t

## 162. Find Peak Element (Medium)

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

## 173. Binary Search Tree Iterator (Medium)

Implement the BSTIterator class that represents an iterator over the in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST):

BSTIterator(TreeNode root) Initializes an object of the BSTIterator class. The root of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
boolean hasNext() Returns true if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns false.
int next() Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.
Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to next() will return the smallest element in the BST.

You may assume that next() calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when next() is called.

## 187. Repeated DNA Sequences (Medium)

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.


## 361. Bomb Enemy (Medium)

Given an m x n matrix grid where each cell is either a wall 'W', an enemy 'E' or empty '0', return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb. You can only place the bomb in an empty cell.

The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted point until it hits the wall since it is too strong to be destroyed.

## 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters (Medium)

Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.

## 651. 4 Keys Keyboard (Medium)

Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:

A: Print one 'A' on the screen.
Ctrl-A: Select the whole screen.
Ctrl-C: Copy selection to buffer.
Ctrl-V: Print buffer on screen appending it after what has already been printed.
Given an integer n, return the maximum number of 'A' you can print on the screen with at most n presses on the keys.

## 1229. Meeting Scheduler (Medium)

Given the availability time slots arrays slots1 and slots2 of two people and a meeting duration duration, return the earliest time slot that works for both of them and is of duration duration.

If there is no common time slot that satisfies the requirements, return an empty array.

The format of a time slot is an array of two elements [start, end] representing an inclusive time range from start to end.

It is guaranteed that no two availability slots of the same person intersect with each other. That is, for any two time slots [start1, end1] and [start2, end2] of the same person, either start1 > end2 or start2 > end1.
